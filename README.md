<!-- description -->
<p>
  <strong> Tools for easy handling of Plate Kinematics functions with Julia üåè üìê. </strong>
</p>

This package provides types, functions and documentation for working with Finite Rotations, Euler Vectors 
and Surface Velocities. The knowledge builds from the framework layed down by Allan Cox in his book 
<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Plate+Tectonics%3A+How+It+Works-p-9781444314212">Plate Tectonics: How It Works</a>.


<!-- installation -->
## Installation

To install, use Julia's built-in package manager (accessed by pressing `]` in the Julia REPL command prompt) 
to add the package and also to instantiate/build all the required dependencies.

```@julia
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.add("PlateKinematics")
```


# Getting started

```@julia
julia> using PlateKinematics
julia> ?PlateKinematics
```

## Examples

Some usage examples may be found under `examples/`. These examples are further explained in the package's [documentation].
