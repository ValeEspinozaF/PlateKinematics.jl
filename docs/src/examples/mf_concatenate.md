# Concatenate Finite Rotations

At time it may be useful to obtain the relative motion between two plates that do not share a divergent margin, or no boundary at all for that matter. The lack of common fracture zones and isochrons produces by a shared spreading center prevents the direct observation of the relative tectonic history between both plates. 

This obstacle can be circunvented by using a plate circuit that links both plates, say Nazca and South-America, by a series of well-defined relative plate motion reconstructions. To connect the Nazca plate to the South-American one, one may use the total reconstruction poles of South-America/Nubia, Nubia/Antarctica, Antarctica/Pacific and Paficic/Nazca:
