## General background

## Important terminology

### Relative and absolute motion


### Euler Pole

Pivot point for a rotation in Euclidean geometry. In Spherical geometry, it is refered as the interception of the axis of rotation with the surface of the Earth. This axis passes through the center of the Earth and naturally intercepts the surface at two opposite points. It is generally agreed among geoscientists to apply the *right-hand rule*, where a positive rotation has the thumb poiting towards the Euler Pole, and the fingers curl along the path of the body in motion. The pole on the opposite side is called *Anti-pole*.
